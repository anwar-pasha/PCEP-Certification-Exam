#Your task is to write a program which removes all the number repetitions from the list. The goal is to have a list in which all the numbers appear not more than once.

mylist = [ 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]
res=[]

for i in range (len(mylist)):
    if mylist[i] not in res:
        res.append(mylist[i])

print(res)
